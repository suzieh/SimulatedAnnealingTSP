Here we explore a meta-heuristic method of optimization known as **"Simulated Annealing"**, a popular heuristic optimization algorithm, most commonly used in minimizing functions of large computational complexity. We will explore this algorithm through it's application to the widely-known Traveling Salesperson Problem.

## Simulated Annealing Algorithm

### Background

Simulated annealing was inspired by the metal working process of annealing, in which the heating and gradual cooling of the metal allows for the physical properties of the metal to be altered.

In this  algorithm, we maintain a "temperature" paramter to mimic the annealing process. The temperature is initailly very high, and cools as the algorithm works. But what does the temperature parameter actually do within the algorithm? To find out, let's explore the difference between a simulated annealing algorithm and a greedy algorithm.

Simulated Annealing is a meta-heuristic optimization method. "Heuristic" come from the Greek word "heuriskein" meaning to find or discover. This is an appropriate naming, as simulated annealing and other heuristic algorithms seek to find optimal or near-optimal solutions through various non-exact tactics so as to minimize computational complexity.

### Simulated Annealing vs. Greedy

Consider the graph above with numerous local minima and the marked global minimum. In a greedy algorithm, no matter where you began your search and the step size, your algorithm would always move to the nearest minima alone since it only seeks steps with a smaller value. However, we can see that if our initial point were between the marked local minima, the algorithm would become satisfied with these minima alone, despite the existence of a better global minimum.

The temperature parameter of simluated annealing allows us to explore even steps which appear to be worse than the current state. When the temperature is high, the algorithm has a higher probability of allowing for a "worse" step to be made, thus allowing more of the graph to be explored and the global minimum is more likely to be found regardless of the starting position of the algorithm.

### Algorithm

Here is a pseudo-code example of the general simulated annealing process:
```{eval = FALSE}
function simulated_annealing ( start_search, iter_max, cooling_function(iter) )
    temperature = some initial high value
    iter = 0
    best = start_search
    repeat until iter >= iter_max :
        neighbor = select neighbor of current search
        if exponential((best - neighbor)/temp) >= random_probability :
            best = neighbor
        temperature = cooling_function(iter)
        iter = iter + 1
    return best
end function
```

### Background

The Traveling Salesperson Problem (commonly abbreviated to TSP) asks a deceptively simple question:

> "Given a list of cities and distances between them, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the original city?"

Consider the picture above. Let's say our salesperson wants to start and end their day at the Gym. We want to find the tour of locations with the smallest overall distance. Such a tour is our ideal solution, which is shown above in the red arrows. Seems simple enough, right? Well, maybe for only six locations it isn't so bad...

This problem was **first formulated in 1930**, and has since been an intensely studied problem in optimization.

TSP is actually considered an **NP-hard problem** in combinatorial optimization, as the number of possible solutions is the factorial of the number of cities ( in big-O notation: **O(n!)** ). Let's put that in perspective: For our problem, we will be exploring a TSP with 44 cites, meaning we hope to find the best of 44! = 2.65827e+54 possible solutions. Computing all of these and their relative distances would be an overwhelming computational task, so we must turn to heuristic optimization methods to determine an approximate solution with greater efficiency. That is where Simulated Annealing comes into play.

<center>**Let's get started!**</center>

### City Data: European Tour

Our Traveling Salesperson has been tasked with visiting most of Continental Europe, so we are going to be helping him travel to each of the European capitals. The data can be found in the git repo.

```{r data}
# Load Data & Clean
citydata <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suzieh/SimulatedAnnealingTSP/master/data/cities_data.csv"))
citydata <- subset(citydata, select=c("city","lon", "lat"))
citydata <- citydata[!(citydata$city == "Reykjavik, Iceland"),]

# Create Distance Matrix
distance_matrix <- matrix(nrow = nrow(citydata), ncol = nrow(citydata))
for (i in 1:nrow(citydata)) {
  current <- c(citydata$lon[i], citydata$lat[i])
  distanceFromCurr <- apply(citydata[,c("lon", "lat")], 1, function (row) { distHaversine(c(row[1], row[2]), c(citydata$lon[i], citydata$lat[i])) })
  distance_matrix[i,] <- distanceFromCurr
}
```

### Helper Functions

We will need various functions for the Simulated Annealing process, all of which are defined and explained here.


#### Neighbors
In order to explore new routes, we want to change part of the current tour and determine if the change is an improvement or not. To determine a "neighbor" for a given tour, we reverse a randomly determined section of the tour.

```{r func_nbr, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#### Neighbor Function
find_neighbor <- function (route) {
  len <- length(route)
  newroute <- route
  # randomly reverse route between two random locations (excluding the start/end)
  swap <- sample(2:(len-1), 2, replace = FALSE)
  newroute[swap[1]:swap[2]] <- rev(newroute[swap[1]:swap[2]])
  return(newroute)
}
```


#### Get Tour Distance
This function calculates the tour distance.
```{r func_dist}
get_dist <- function (route) {
  sum <- 0
  for (i in 1:(length(route)-1)) {
    sum <- sum + distance_matrix[route[i], route[i+1]]
  }
  return(sum)
}
```


#### Compare Tour Distances
This function calculates the relative distance between the two tours. A positive result indicates the new tour is shorter, while a negative result indicates the new tour is worse than the current one.
```{r func_diff, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
get_diff <- function (route_next, route_x) {
  # calculate route distances
  sum_next <- get_dist(route_next)
  sum_x <- get_dist(route_x)
  # determine difference
  diff <- sum_x - sum_next
  return(diff)
}
```


#### Cooling Function
This function is a key aspect of Simulated Annealing. The temperature determines how "random" the environment is, allowing for expanded exploration through an increased rate of accepting "worse" conditions. I have elected to use Newton's Law of Cooling here: _dT/dt = -ky_. Where _dT/dt_ is the change in temperature over time (in our case, iterations), _k_ is a constant for intensity of cooling, and _y_ is the current temperature state.
```{r func_cool, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
temperature <- function (t0, k, n) {
  # t0 : initial temperature
  # n : current iteration step
  # Apply Newton's Law of Cooling
  k <- k/10
  newtemp <- t0 * exp(-k * n)
  return(newtemp)
}
```


#### Drawing Functions
These functions draw the maps and graphs showing the progress of the algorithm.
```{r draw_map}
# *note: these functions assume use of the 'citydata' provided,
#        if you wish to use your own data set, you must change
#        all apropriate functions as well, including the map
#        function below.

# Adjust Map to Window Size
plotmap2spdf <- function (mp) {
  # Convert data from a "maps" object to a "SpatialPolygonsDataFrame" object
  SP <- map2SpatialPolygons(mp, IDs = mp$names,
                            proj4string = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))
  DATA <- data.frame(seq_len(length(SP)), row.names = names(SP))
  SPDF <- SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(SP, data = DATA)
  return(SPDF)
}

# Drawing Map
draw_map <- function (tour) {
  ## Conversion
  mp <- map(database = "world", fill = TRUE, col = "grey80", border = "grey40",
            xlim = c(-10,40), ylim = c(32, 65), plot = FALSE)
  spdf <- plotmap2spdf(mp)
  
  ## Countries and borders (use convert)
  out <- spplot(spdf, col.regions = "grey80", colorkey = FALSE,
                xlim = c(-10,40), ylim = c(32,65))

  ## Cities
  out <- out + layer(panel.points(lon, lat, type = "p", pch = 19, cex = .8, col = "black"), data = citydata)

  ## Tour
  x0 <- c() # vector of x values (from)
  y0 <- c() # vector of y values (from)
  x1 <- c() # vector of x values (to)
  y1 <- c() # vector of y values (to)
  for (i in 1:(length(tour)-1)) {
    x0 <- c(x0, citydata$lon[tour[i]])
    y0 <- c(y0, citydata$lat[tour[i]])
    x1 <- c(x1, citydata$lon[tour[i+1]])
    y1 <- c(y1, citydata$lat[tour[i+1]])
  }
  mydf <- data.frame("x0" = x0, "y0" = y0, "x1" = x1, "y1" = y1)
  out <- out + layer(panel.segments(x0, y0, x1, y1, col="black", lwd = 1), data = mydf)
  
  ## Return plot
  return(out)
}
```

```{r draw_temps}
# Drawing Temperatures
draw_temps <- function (temps) {
  len <- length(temps)
  ## Create Plot
  p <- plot(temps, pch = 20, xlim = c(0, len), ylim = c(0,2000),
            xlab = "", ylab = "Temperature", main = "Temperatures")
  p <- p + lines(temps, type = "l", lwd = 1.5)
  ## Return plot
  return(p)
}
```

```{r draw_dists}
# Drawing Distances
draw_dists <- function (dists) {
  len <- length(dists)
  max <- max(dists)
  min <- min(dists)
  ## Create Plot
  p <- plot(dists, pch = 20, xlim = c(0, len), ylim = c(min,max),
            xlab = "", ylab = "Tour Distance", main = "Distances")
  p <- p + lines(dists, type = "l", lwd = 1.5)
  ## Return plot
  return(p)
}
```


### Simulated Annealing Function
Here we have the main body of the simulated annealing algorithm, beginning with a random tour we will then try to optimize. Note that the start/end location is also randomly chosen.
```{r main}
# Simulated Annealing Main Function
simulated_annealing <- function(n_max=1500, t0=1000, k=.6, p=0.4) {
  # Parameters
  ## n_max : number of iterations
  ## t0 : initial temperature
  ## k : constant for cooling rate (exponential function)
  ## p : probability of accepting worse case
  
  # Tracking Temp/Distances/Tours
  all_temperatures <- c()
  all_distances <- c()
  tour_progress <- list()
  # Create an intial tour
  x <- sample(1:nrow(citydata), nrow(citydata), replace = FALSE)
  x <- c(x,x[1])   # make sure last entry matches first
  x_best <- x      # initial tour is best known
  n <- 0           # keep track of iterations
  
  # Begin Loop
  while (n <= n_max) {
    # Set initial values
    temp <- temperature(t0, k, n)
    x_next <- find_neighbor(x)
    diff_val <- get_diff(x_next, x)
    # Determine whether to accept next iteration
    if (diff_val > 0) {
      x <- x_next
    } else if (exp(diff_val/temp) >= p) {
      x <- x_next
    }
    # Change current best as needed
    if (get_diff(x, x_best) > 0) {
      x_best <- x
    }
    # Keep track of temperatures, accepted tour distances
    all_temperatures <- c(all_temperatures, temp)
    all_distances <- c(all_distances, get_dist(x))
    # Every 100 iterations, record current tour
    if (n %% 100 == 0) {
      curr <- (n / 100) + 1
      tour_progress[[curr]] <- x
    }
    # Update iteration
    n <- n+1
  }
  
  # Return the x_best, all_temperatures, all_distances, tour_progress
  ret <- list(x_best, all_temperatures, all_distances, tour_progress)
  return(ret)
}
```
